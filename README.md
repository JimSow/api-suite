Cyc Java API Suite
==================

The Cyc API comprises a suite of Java APIs for developing Cyc-based applications or otherwise
accessing Cyc capabilities, and provides a layered suite of functionality.

We have currently released the [Core API Suite](core-api-suite/README.md). Further functionality 
will be rolled out in a series of releases, including the Knowledge Management, Natural Language, 
Model Generator, Structured Knowledge, and Administration APIs:
